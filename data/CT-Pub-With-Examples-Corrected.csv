   IGT is defined by:
   * fasting plasma glucose \< 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/l), and
   * 2 hour plasma glucose 140-199 mg/dL (7.8 - 11mmol/l),

   * 2 hour plasma glucose \< 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/l)
10. Subject has HLA DQA1\*0102, DQB1\*0602 haplotype.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system (the part of the body which helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin (islet cells found in the pancreas). As these cells are destroyed, the body's ability to produce insulin decreases. There is evidence suggesting that repeated oral administration of an autoantigen (the same protein that the immune system is reacting to) may introduce a protective immunity and cause the immune system to stop its attack. An earlier, large scale study was done to see if oral insulin could delay or prevent the development of Type 1 diabetes in relatives at risk for developing Type 1 diabetes. The overall results showed that for the entire study population, oral insulin did not delay or prevent Type 1 diabetes. However, an analysis that was done after the conclusion of the trial suggested a potential beneficial effect in a subgroup of participants. The participants who seemed to benefit from oral insulin had higher levels of insulin autoantibodies which are directed against insulin itself ( called mIAA).

The Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet study group will further explore the potential role of oral insulin to delay or prevent Type 1 diabetes in a similar group of people. The study will also include a secondary group of individuals at different levels of risk than those in the primary cohort to gather information for future studies.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, ","Oral Insulin, Placebo, ","Rate of Type 1 Diabetes Per Year Among Individuals in the Primary Stratum When Treated With Oral Inulin Versus Placebo, ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Stratum, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Stratum`, ","Age, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, BMI, Family Members with T1DM, Number of Autoantibodies positive, HbA1C, First phase insulin release, c-peptide, Human leukocyte antigen allele","`Age`, `Sex`, `Race/Ethnicity`, `BMI`, `Family Members with T1DM`, `Number of Autoantibodies positive`, `HbA1C`, `First phase insulin release`, `c-peptide`, `Human leukocyte antigen allele`, "

1. Administering the immunosuppression induction agent rATG (""rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin"") in a single dose at the time of transplantation, instead of in the usual series of 4 smaller doses over 6 days.
2. After 6 months, modifying the maintenance immunosuppression used to prevent rejection by replacing the drug tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

Individuals who meet criteria according to the phone screen will be invited to come to the unit for a screening visit and their screening sheets are placed in a locked filing cabinet. Forms from potential volunteers who are ineligible are shredded.","Background:

- Sticking to a diet plan can be difficult, but is important for many different health reasons. Some people seem to have a harder time following and sticking to a diet plan than others. It is not clear whether people of different weights (lean or obese) might have differences in the way they adhere to diet plans. Researchers want to study three different groups of people based on their body mass index (BMI), which measures people based on their weight and height. The study will place the participants on a 6-week diet and see how well they follow the diet. The information from this study may help develop better weight-loss plans and healthy diet ideas.

Objectives:

* To understand what factors affect adherence to a diet plan.
* To collect information for future studies that may improve people's ability to stick to diets.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who are lean (BMI between 18.5 and 25) or obese (BMI greater than 30).

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. They will have a full-body scan to measure fat and muscle. They will also answer questions on eating behaviors, mood, and desire to change eating patterns.
* Participants will be separated into three groups. Each group will have a different diet. The lean group will have a heart-healthy diet designed to maintain the same weight. One of the obese groups will also have a heart-healthy diet designed to maintain the same weight. The other obese group will have a heart-healthy weight loss diet. In all groups, all food will be provided by the study doctors. Participants should not eat any food other than that provided for the study.
* Everyone will start with a 1-week food testing period to find the right number of calories for each group. After this first week, participants will attend one diet counseling session per week and will be contacted randomly once a week to check on the foods they have had in the past 24 hours. Participants will complete daily food diaries on paper as well as daily food records using a smart phone.
* Participants will come to the clinic twice a week to pick up the diet food. On one of those days, they will also have their counseling session.
* The study will last for 6 weeks. At the final study visit, participants will repeat the tests from the screening study.","Obesity, Overweight, ","Underfeeding diet, Weight maintaining diet, ","Adherence Score, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Weight, kg, Height, cm, BMI (kg/m^2), ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Weight, kg`, `Height, cm`, `BMI (kg/m^2)`, ","Race/ethnicity, Sex, Age, Education, SSS, Weight, Height, BMI, PFAT, FM, FFM, Waist, WMEN","`Race/ethnicity`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Education`, `SSS`, `Weight`, `Height`, `BMI`, `PFAT`, `FM`, `FFM`, `Waist`, `WMEN`, "

* Patients must be at least 18 years of age
* Patients must be willing and able to provide consent
* Patients must be eligible for pacemaker/ICD removal or temporary pacemaker

Exclusion Criteria:

* Pregnancy
* Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol
* Medical condition that would limit study participation","If a surgical sponge is mistakenly left inside a patient's body after a surgical procedure, it can cause a serious infection. To prevent this from happening, a new device has been developed that uses radiofrequency (RF) signals to detect the presence of surgical sponges inside the body. The device is now being used routinely to make sure that no sponges are left inside a patient at the end of an operation. However, the RF device has not been implemented in procedures for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). While the device is FDA approved for use, there is a theoretical concern that the radiofrequency signals used to detect the sponges will change the settings on the pacemaker or the defibrillator. Changing the settings on a pacemaker might make it pace the heart too quickly or too slowly, while changing the settings on a defibrillator might cause unnecessary shocks or prevent it from shocking the heart if the patient were to have cardiac arrest.

The purpose of this study is to test whether the radiofrequency device used to detect sponges can cause a clinically significant change to the settings on pacemakers and defibrillators. To minimize potential risk, the device will be tested only on patients who are having the pacemaker or defibrillator removed or replaced as part of their regular medical care, either because it is infected or because the battery has worn out. Before the pacemaker or defibrillator is removed, the settings will be carefully and completely recorded and the radiofrequency device will be used to scan the body for sponges as it would be done during normal operation.

After the pacemaker or defibrillator is taken out, the settings will again be recorded and compared to the settings before the scan. In a standard device removal procedure, no clinically significant change in CIED settings would be expected. If a new pacemaker or defibrillator is implanted in the patient, it will not be exposed to the detection device at all.

6. History of statin intolerance","Background:

There is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients to lower plasma cholesterol levels can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in some individuals1-5. The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D.

The goals of this study are to:

1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES);
2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin;
3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES);
4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES).

General approach:

This will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin.","Hyperlipidemia, Insulin Resistance, Type 2 Diabetes, ","Atorvastatin, ","Steady-state Plasma Glucose (SSPG), Insulin Secretion Rate Area Under the Curve (ISR-AUC), ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, BMI, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `BMI`, ","Age, Female, Race, BMI, Waist circumference, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Heart rate, Prediabetes, Metabolic syndrome","`Age`, `Female`, `Race`, `BMI`, `Waist circumference`, `Systolic BP`, `Diastolic BP`, `Heart rate`, `Prediabetes`, `Metabolic syndrome`, "

5. Has severe back-pain or motion disorders that make it hard for a child to lie on his/her back within the MRI scanner and hold still for the scan.","Background:

Some studies have found that people can better process sugars when they take walking breaks. Studies have also found that children's attention and memory may improve after exercise. It is not known if short walking breaks have the same effects. Researchers want to study if breaking up sitting with walking for 6 days helps children s bodies use sugars and improves concentration.

Objectives:

To learn if breaking up sedentary (low-activity) time with short walking breaks over 6 days affects how children s bodies use sugar. To learn if breaking up sedentary time changes children s attention, memory, feelings, activity, or eating.

Eligibility:

Children ages 7-11 in general good health

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Fasting blood tests. On 2 out of 7 total study visits, participants cannot eat or drink after 10 p.m. the night before.
* Full-body X-ray
* EKG (Electronic signals that record heart function through stickers)
* Treadmill exercise. Heart, blood pressure, and oxygen will be monitored.
* Questions about the child s health, socialization, and activity, and parent s education and economic status
* Picture vocabulary test
* Dietician meeting (Questions about eating habits)

Participants will have visits on 6 consecutive days. Over that time, they will wear 2 devices to monitor blood sugar and activity (even while at home).

Participants will have 5 after-school visits. These include:

* Health check
* Snack plus food for the next 24 hours
* Activity monitored
* 3-hour sitting tests. Participants will do non-active things. Some will have 3-minute walks every 30 minutes.
* Cognitive tests and questions about mood and anxiety are given on days #1 \& 5.

The new drug ONC201 have been shown to kill breast cancer and endometrial cancer cells in the laboratory. The exact mechanism of action is not completely clear yet, but the ONC201 destroys the mitochondria inside the cells. Blocking mitochondrial activity may kill tumor cells, which would shrink tumors. Researchers want to see if ONC201 helps shrink tumors of certain breast or endometrial cancers and if that effect is maintained.

Objective:

To see if ONC201 shrinks tumors with a lasting effect.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older who have metastatic breast cancer (hormone-positive or triple-negative) or metastatic endometrial cancers.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Heart, blood, and urine tests
* Computed tomography (CT) and bone scans
* Review of medical report and tumor sample
* Participants will have a tumor biopsy before starting treatment and after 5 weeks taking the study drug. A scan or ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy. Patients will receive local anesthetic and a needle will remove a small piece of tumor.
* The study will be done in 28-day cycles. Every day 1 of each cycle participants will repeat most screening tests, will be seen by the physician and receive a supply of the study drug.
* Participants will take the study drug by mouth once every 7 days. They will keep a diary of when they take the drug and any side effects. During cycle 1, participants will get weekly calls to discuss their health and symptoms. Images will be repeated every 2 cycles to evaluate response to the treatment.","Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer, ","ONC201, ","Cohort 1 - Progression-free Survival (PFS), Cohort 2 - Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Cohort 3 - Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), ",cancer,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, ","Sex, Stage, Age, Number of Prior Therapies,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, Cancer Subtypes","`Sex`, `Stage`, `Age`, `Number of Prior Therapies`, `Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status`, `Cancer Subtypes`, "

4. Current participation in a PA study.","Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a novel, low-cost, and scalable strategy for promoting PA among individuals facing socio-environmental barriers to PA.","Cardiovascular Risk Factor, Prediabetes, Overweight and Obesity, Sedentary Behavior, ","The Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention, Be Active Your Way Booklet, ","Percentage of Participants Retained at the End of Study, Percentage of Participants Who Self-monitored Step Count Using Wrist Worn ActiGraph GT9X Over the Study Period, Acceptability of PATH Intervention, ",hypertension,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Body Mass Index, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Objective weekly MVPA minutes, Adherence to MVPA guidelines at baseline, Objective average daily steps, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Body Mass Index`, `Systolic Blood Pressure`, `Diastolic Blood Pressure`, `Objective weekly MVPA minutes`, `Adherence to MVPA guidelines at baseline`, `Objective average daily steps`, ","Race, Sex, Age, Education, Employment, BMI, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Self-reported weekly MVPA (moderate-vigorous physical activity) using MAQ (modified activity questionnaire), Objective weekly MVPA (moderate-vigorous physical activity) minutes, Adherence to MVPA guidelines (≥150 mins/wk), Objective average daily steps, Adherence to steps guidelines (≥7500 steps/day)","`Race`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Education`, `Employment`, `BMI`, `Systolic BP`, `Diastolic BP`, `Self-reported weekly MVPA (moderate-vigorous physical activity) using MAQ (modified activity questionnaire)`, `Objective weekly MVPA (moderate-vigorous physical activity) minutes`, `Adherence to MVPA guidelines (≥150 mins/wk)`, `Objective average daily steps`, `Adherence to steps guidelines (≥7500 steps/day)`, "
