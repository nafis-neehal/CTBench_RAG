* failure to achieve a T6 level of anesthesia
* conversion to general anesthesia","Hypotension remains a common clinical problem after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Maternal hypotension has been associated with considerable morbidity (maternal nausea and vomiting and fetal/neonatal acidemia). Traditionally, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice because of concerns about phenylephrine's potential adverse effect on uterine blood flow. This practice was based on animal studies which showed that ephedrine maintained cardiac output and uterine blood flow, while direct acting vasoconstrictors, e.g., phenylephrine, decreased uteroplacental perfusion. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that phenylephrine has similar efficacy to ephedrine for preventing and treating hypotension and may be associated with a lower incidence of fetal acidosis. All of these studies have been performed in healthy patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery.

Preeclampsia complicates 5-6% of all pregnancies and is a significant contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Many preeclamptic patients require cesarean delivery of the infant. These patients often have uteroplacental insufficiency. Given the potential for significant hypotension after spinal anesthesia and its effect on an already compromised fetus, prevention of (relative) hypotension in preeclamptic patients is important. Spinal anesthesia in preeclamptic patients has been shown to have no adverse neonatal outcomes as compared to epidural anesthesia when hypotension is treated adequately. Due to problems related to management of the difficult airway and coagulopathy, both of which are more common in preeclamptic women, spinal anesthesia may be the preferred regional anesthesia technique. Recent studies have demonstrated that preeclamptic patients may experience less hypotension after spinal anesthesia than their healthy counterparts. To our knowledge, phenylephrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has not been studied in women with preeclampsia. The aim of our study is to compare intravenous infusion regimens of phenylephrine versus ephedrine for the treatment of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension in preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The primary outcome variable is umbilical artery pH.","Preeclampsia, Hypotension, ","Ephedrine, Phenylephrine, ","The Umbilical Artery pH, ",hypertension,"Age, Categorical, Sex: Female, Male, Region of Enrollment, Estimated gestational age (weeks), Multiple gestation, Preeclampsia, Number of infants delivered per group, Baseline systolic blood pressure, Baseline heart rate, Body mass index, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Estimated gestational age (weeks)`, `Multiple gestation`, `Preeclampsia`, `Number of infants delivered per group`, `Baseline systolic blood pressure`, `Baseline heart rate`, `Body mass index`, "

NCT01268553,Transition From Injectable Prostacyclin Medication to Inhaled Prostacyclin Medication,"Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients with WHO group I PAH
* Stable patients with NYHA/WHO functional class I or II
* Age \>18
* Treatment for PAH with parenteral prostanoid (IV epoprostenol, IV or SQ treprostinil) for at least 90 days
* Dose of prostanoid \< 20 ng/kg/min
* mPAP \< 40 mmHg and RAP \<12 mmHg on catheterization
* Clinical decision to convert from parenteral prostanoid therapy to inhaled treprostinil therapy

Exclusion Criteria:

* Concomitant underlying medical condition limiting ability to perform exercise
* Addition of new PAH medication within the past 90 days prior to enrollment
* Participation in a clinical study involving an investigational drug or device \< 4 weeks prior to the screening visit
* Any additional contraindications and precautions specified in the package inserts for treprostinil (Tyvaso) not listed above","The purpose of this study is to assess tolerability and clinical effects of transition from intravenous (IV, needle in the vein) or subcutaneous (SQ, needle in the skin) to the recently-approved inhaled treprostinil (Tyvaso) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Our hypothesis is that the transition to inhaled treprostinil will be tolerated by patients.

The intravenous and subcutaneous drugs epoprostenol and treprostinil received approval for treatment of PAH many years ago. While these medications improve exercise capacity and the symptoms of PAH, they are given by injection and thus have several side effects, such as pain and catheter infection. This has resulted in many patients either refusing to take the medication or quitting these medications because of not tolerating them.

The only other form of prostacyclin treatment available for PAH patients is inhaled. There are 2 inhaled prostacyclins approved for PAH, however one of these requires at least 6 inhalations per day, every day, and takes about 30 minutes to inhale each time. Thus, it has not been a regularly-used medication and issues surrounding compliance make it a riskier drug to use if patients do not get their full doses every day. The other inhaled medication, treprostinil, was approved a few months ago, only needs to be given 4 times a day, and takes about 2-3 minutes to inhale.

Since inhaled treprostinil can be administered easily, it is anticipated that many patients will transition from epoprostenol or treprostinil to the recently approved inhaled treprostinil, however we do not know if this is a safe or effective way to manage patients. Thus, the goal of this prospective study is to gather observational data regarding how that switch is made, tolerability of the switch, and, to the extent possible with this methodology, assess clinical effects of the switch.

This is a prospective study. Twenty patients \> 18 years old with PAH will be enrolled. Patients enrolled will be those in whom a clinical decision to convert from either IV epoprostenol, IV treprostinil, or SQ treprostinil to inhaled treprostinil therapy has been made. This is usually the result of patients asking to switch to inhaled therapy, but only allowed by physicians if they feel the switch would be safe.

If eligible, and after informed consent, patients will have a history and physical examination, a 6 min walk test, a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), blood tests, and a symptom questionnaire will be filled out. Patients will then be admitted to the hospital where a monitoring catheter will be placed inside the patient's heart and inhaled treprostinil will be initiated, while the dose of IV/SQ medication is reduced over about 24-26 hours.

Clinical follow-up will be at weeks 1, 4, and 12.

The procedures above are all part of the routine clinical care that patients would receive if they were to be transitioned to inhaled therapy, including the hospitalization and catheterization. The criteria for them to be able to be switched are conservative. Pressure in their heart and lungs must be low (mPAP \< 40 mmHg and RAP \<12 mmHg on catheterization), and their dose of IV or SQ medication must be low (\< 20 ng/kg/min). Regarding the patient subset enrolled in this study in whom a clinical decision to convert transition therapy has been made, we will try to ensure that our clinical decision-making will not be influenced by the need to enroll subjects in the study by explicitly noting the potential for conflict of interest with each patient (addressed in the ICF). We will not make a clinical decision for our patients based on the desire to fill the study numbers, and every will be made to avoid the potential for a perceived conflict of interest.","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, ","Treprostinil, ","Number of Participants Without Adverse Events, ",hypertension,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Region of Enrollment, pulmonary vascular resistance, 6-minute walk distance, peak oxygen consumption, ratio of minute ventilation to CO2 output, The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Region of Enrollment`, `pulmonary vascular resistance`, `6-minute walk distance`, `peak oxygen consumption`, `ratio of minute ventilation to CO2 output`, `The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)`, "

Preliminary evidence suggests that ambrisentan is safe and effective in patients with portopulmonary hypertension. The goal of therapy for these patients is to improve symptoms of dyspnea and to improve pulmonary hemodynamics to a mean pulmonary artery pressure \<35 mm Hg in order to make patients eligible for liver transplantation. Therefore, the primary endpoints for this study will include 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).

Eligible subjects will receive 5 mg ambrisentan once-daily for the first 4 weeks. After the initial 4-week period, investigators will increase study drug dose to 10 mg once daily (both 5 mg and 10 mg doses are FDA approved). If 10 mg is not tolerated in the opinion of investigator, then the investigator may decrease the dose back to 5 mg once daily. Primary outcome is a change in both the 6 Minute Walk Distance and in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance from baseline to Week 24. Subjects will be monitored with liver function tests (LFT) every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter. These safety laboratory tests may be performed at a local phlebotomy laboratory or at the Investigator clinic. In addition, the Investigator will assess each subject for safety and efficacy at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24. Following Week 24, subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy every 12 weeks. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year.

These disorders affect 1 out of every 10 pregnancies, the rate is increasing in the United States, and rate of recurrence is as high as 50%. Treatments to prevent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy from happening in future pregnancies are limited. There are currently no effective interventions to prevent hypertension recurrence in pregnancy that do not involve medications.

Mindfulness interventions hold great potential as a medication-free approach to prevent the recurrence of hypertension in pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders. However, traditional group-based mindfulness training interventions, requiring 2.5 hours of class attendance for 8 weeks plus a full-day retreat, are very difficult for pregnant women with medical conditions to attend.

The goal of the current study is to determine if phone-delivered mindfulness training is an acceptable intervention among pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. 20 pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will be randomly picked to participate in an 8-week phone-delivered mindfulness training intervention (N=10) or usual care (N=10). All women will undergo blood pressure monitoring before and after the intervention. The investigators predict that phone-delivered mindfulness training will reduce risk for hypertension recurrence.","Hypertension in Pregnancy, ","Mindfulness Training, ","Retention and Adherence, ",hypertension,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Systolic blood pressure, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Systolic blood pressure`, "

The inability to predict a patient's IOP response to medications is a critical barrier for the clinician to consistently provide highly effective IOP-based treatments. Current trial-and error approaches to glaucoma management are inefficient and have not addressed this barrier as there are no predictive factors for drug response. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes by identifying biomarkers and environmental factors that profile a patient at risk for glaucoma by age-of-onset, rate of disease progression, ""poor response"" to treatment, and large IOP fluctuation. Our purpose of this research project is to address this critical barrier by focusing on physiological factors that predict IOP response to drugs.","Glaucoma, Healthy, ","Variation in eye pressure response to timolol and latanoprost treatment, ","Variation in Eye Pressure Between Individuals., ",hypertension,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Intraocular pressure, Aqueous humor flow, Episcleral venous pressure, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Intraocular pressure`, `Aqueous humor flow`, `Episcleral venous pressure`, "

In recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences. This contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a novel, low-cost, and scalable strategy for promoting PA among individuals facing socio-environmental barriers to PA.","Cardiovascular Risk Factor, Prediabetes, Overweight and Obesity, Sedentary Behavior, ","The Physical Activity for The Heart (PATH) intervention, Be Active Your Way Booklet, ","Percentage of Participants Retained at the End of Study, Percentage of Participants Who Self-monitored Step Count Using Wrist Worn ActiGraph GT9X Over the Study Period, Acceptability of PATH Intervention, ",hypertension,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Body Mass Index, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Objective weekly MVPA minutes, Adherence to MVPA guidelines at baseline, Objective average daily steps, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Body Mass Index`, `Systolic Blood Pressure`, `Diastolic Blood Pressure`, `Objective weekly MVPA minutes`, `Adherence to MVPA guidelines at baseline`, `Objective average daily steps`, "

* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because everolimus has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with everolimus, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with everolimus. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
* Individuals with a recent history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: 1) Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years OR are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; 2) Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

Patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and antidiabetic treatment must be monitored closely throughout the trial and adjusted as necessary.","In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the clinical benefit of everolimus in cancer patients with inactivating TSC1 or TSC2 mutations or activating MTOR mutations.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug called everolimus to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved everolimus for your type of cancer.

Everolimus is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by blocking an important factor (mTOR) involved in the growth of cells. This drug has been used in treatment for other cancers and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of several types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma. Treatment with this drug has been associated with responses in some patients whose cancers had mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. The investigators think that patients whose tumors have mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 may have a good chance of responding to treatment with drugs like everolimus.","TSC1, TSC2, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, MTOR, ","Everolimus, ","Objective Response Rate, ",cancer,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, ECOG Performance Status, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `ECOG Performance Status`, "

* Age 18 years or older
* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly differentiated carcinomas of the head and neck or lymphoepithelioma
* Prior radiation to the head and neck, surgery or chemotherapy is allowed
* Karnofsky performance status of \>= 70%

* Obtained informed consent

Exclusion Criteria:

* Demonstration of metastatic disease (i.e. M1 disease).
* Incomplete healing from previous surgery
* Pregnancy or breast feeding (men and women of child-bearing potential are eligible but must consent to using effective contraception during therapy and for at least 3 months after completing therapy)
* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
* Patients with clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, or any history of clinically significant CHF are excluded. The exclusion of patients with active coronary artery disease will be at the discretion of the attending physician.
* Uncontrolled active infection unless curable with treatment of their cancer.","There is no optimal treatment for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer after previous radiation. Chemotherapy alone is not curative and patients survive an average of only 6 to 10 months. Surgery is not always possible and often cannot remove every cancerous cell. On the other hand, reirradiation with chemotherapy cures approximately 25 to 30% of patients but has significant toxicity with as many as 15 to 20% suffering from life-threatening or fatal complications. Therefore, less toxic and more effective reirradiation regimens are urgently needed. There are extensive data from animal studies and preliminary human studies showing that blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and COX-2 enhances radiation effect and is more effective than either treatment alone. Erlotinib is a FDA approved oral inhibitor of EGFR and celecoxib is a FDA approved COX-2 inhibitor. Both have been well studied in humans and appear to have less severe toxicity than conventional chemotherapeutic agents.","Cancer of the Pharynx, Cancer of the Larynx, Cancer of the Neck, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms, Cancer of the Head, ","erlotinib + celecoxib, ","Toxicity, ",cancer,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race (NIH/OMB), ECOG Performance Status, Tobacco use, pack-years, Recurrent vs secondary primary, Histology, Primary Site, Primary tumor classification, Lymph node status, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `ECOG Performance Status`, `Tobacco use, pack-years`, `Recurrent vs secondary primary`, `Histology`, `Primary Site`, `Primary tumor classification`, `Lymph node status`, "

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether it works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the study intervention is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved this study intervention for your type of cancer.

All participants on this study are treated in an identical manner. The investigators are doing this study because there continues to be a significant risk of relapse of disease after reduced intensity transplantation. In studies which have compared transplants using high-doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation versus reduced intensity transplants, patients undergoing reduced intensity transplants appear to have higher rates of relapse, but lower rates of toxicity and complication. This study attempts to utilize clofarabine, a newer chemotherapy agent shown to be quite active in AML, ALL, and MDS, to increase the anti-tumor effects of the conditioning regimen without accumulating unacceptable toxicity.

The reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation procedure involves giving you chemotherapy in relatively less intense doses to suppress your immune system. This is followed by an infusion of healthy blood stem cells from a matched related donor or a matched unrelated volunteer donor. It is hoped that these donor cells can eventually then attack any cancer cells which remain.

In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well this new combination of busulfan and clofarabine works in reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation. By ""works"" the investigators mean to analyze safety, ability of donor cells to engraft (take hold), as well as measures of complications including toxicity, infections, graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), and relapse.","Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, ","Busulfan, Clofarabine, Allogeneic Stem Cell Infusion, ","Assessment of Donor Stem Cell Engraftment: ANC Count, Donor Stem Cell Engraftment: Platelet Count, ",cancer,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Region of Enrollment, Diagnosis, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) Refined Disease Risk Index (DRI), Disease Stage, Cytogenics for patients with AML/MDS, ALL Cytogenics, Hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), Donor Type, Cytomegalovirus Serostatus, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Diagnosis`, `Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) Refined Disease Risk Index (DRI)`, `Disease Stage`, `Cytogenics for patients with AML/MDS`, `ALL Cytogenics`, `Hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI)`, `Donor Type`, `Cytomegalovirus Serostatus`, "

Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \>20 mm with conventional techniques or as \>10 mm with CT scan). RECIST criteria will be used (see section 9).

Therapeutic history in conformance with the following:

No more than one prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen that may have included biologic/targeted agent.

No more than one prior regimen (chemotherapy or biologic/targeted) for recurrent/metastatic disease

ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky \> 60%; see Appendix A).

Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) 5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits

OR

creatinine clearance \> 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis for Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio (see Appendix). For UPC ratio \> 0.5, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be \<1000 mg for patient enrollment.

Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is calculated using on of the following formula:

\[urine protein\]/\[urine creatinine\] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/Dl \[(urine protein) x0.088\]/\[urine creatinine\] - if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L

All patients should have baseline tumor tissue available for EGFR determination (therapeutic target of cetuximab) and biomarker studies. Patients without available tissue at baseline may undergo tumor biopsy. Patients who provide consent and have accessible tumors will have a repeat biopsy 14 days (an interval between 12-16 days is acceptable) post initiation of therapy. Priority for study entry will be given to patients with easily accessible tumor and who consent to repeat biopsy. Study entry will not be restricted to patients who agree to further biopsies. If a patient enrolls on study and later refuses biopsy (excluding diagnostic), he/she may remain on study.

No prior treatment with cetuximab or bevacizumab or other EGFR or VEGF targeting agents.

Patients should not have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) and biologic/targeted agents within 3 weeks. At least 3 months should have elapsed after prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies.

At least 3 weeks should have elapsed from prior radiotherapy.

Patients must have no history of gross hemoptysis (defined as bright red blood of a ½ teaspoon or more) or coagulopathy. Patients with history of major tumor-related bleeding that is not controlled despite locoregional treatment or at high risk of recurrent tumor-related bleeding will be excluded.

Patients should not have a history of thrombosis (e.g. pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis) and should not be on therapeutic anticoagulation (prophylactic use of warfarin 1 mg per day is allowed) and INR should be less than 1.5 at registration.

Patients with history of hypertension must be well-controlled (≤150/100) on a stable regimen of anti-hypertensive therapy.

Patients with tumors that invaded major vessels (e.g. the carotid) as shown unequivocally by imaging studies will be excluded due to the possibility of increased risk for tumor bleeding with bevacizumab therapy.

No major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study enrollment, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study. No history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to registration. No serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

No unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months; no uncontrolled hypertension; no symptomatic congestive heart failure; no serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; no clinically significant peripheral vascular disease; no history of any CNS cerebrovascular ischemia or stroke within the last 6 months; no active serious infection.

No other coexisting medical condition that would preclude full compliance with the study.

Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because of increased risks with bevacizumab.

Patients should not have a history of prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody. Patients with known hypersensitivity of Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human antibodies.

No history of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, unless there is a 3-year disease-free interval.

Age \> 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of cetuximab and bevacizumab in patients \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.

Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cetuximab and bevacizumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cetuximab and bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab. The effects of cetuximab and bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible drug interactions with cetuximab and bevacizumab. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.

As of September 1, 2004, the study was expanded to a total of 6 arms (the original 3 arms (A, B, C) and 3 additional arms which were the same as the first 3 but with cetuximab) in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage III colon cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with monoclonal antibody therapy and giving them after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It was not known at the time this study was developed which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective after surgery in treating colon cancer. This study had several key changes, based on the results of other phase III trials. As of 6/1/2005, patients no longer received irinotecan on this study and treatment arms B, C, E, and F were discontinued. Patients on arms B and C crossed to arm A. Patients on arms E and F crossed to arm D. Patients on arms C and F who had not gotten to irinotecan continued on arms A and D, respectively. As of 8/18/2008, pre-screening for Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) status was added with mutant KRAS (or KRAS not evaluable) patients put on arm G and wild-type KRAS patients randomized between arm A and arm D. Patients on arm G were treated per physician discretion and followed for disease and survival status. KRAS was determined in a central laboratory and was process for all patients on this study. The primary endpoint of this study was modified on 8/18/2008 to focus on patients having wild-type KRAS tumors. All modifications were approved by the Central Institution Review Board, local Institutional Review Boards, NCI, and the NCCTG Data Safety Monitoring Board.","Adenocarcinoma of the Colon, Stage III Colon Cancer, ","irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, cetuximab, Locally Directed Therapy, ","Disease-free Survival (Arms A and D: Wild-type KRAS Patients), ",cancer,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Positive Nodes, Tumor Stage, Histologic Grade, KRAS Status, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Positive Nodes`, `Tumor Stage`, `Histologic Grade`, `KRAS Status`, "

- Cabozantinib is a drug that slows the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. It is approved for medullary thyroid cancer. However, studies have shown that prostate tumors respond to it. Docetaxel and prednisone are standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer. Researchers want to see if adding cabozantinib to these two drugs can be a safe and effective treatment for this type of cancer.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of cabozantinib with standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced prostate cancer that has not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.
* Participants will receive the cancer drugs over 21-day cycles of treatment. They will take docetaxel and cabozantinib on day 1 of each cycle. Each docetaxel infusion will take about 1 hour. They will also take prednisone by mouth twice each day.
* Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.
* Participants will continue to take the study drugs for as long as their cancer does not worsen and side effects are not too severe.","Prostatic Neoplasms, ","Cabozantinib, Docetaxel, Prednisone, ","Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Cabozantinib + Docetaxel + Prednisone Compared to Docetaxel + Prednisone Alone, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), ",cancer,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Baseline Prostatic-Specific Antigen (PSA), Prior Treatment with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Baseline Prostatic-Specific Antigen (PSA)`, `Prior Treatment with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone`, "

  * Painful, as defined by a pain score ≥ 2 for worst pain in the planned target treatment volume;
  * ≤ 3 consecutive spinal segments involved by tumour to be included in the planned target volume. The patient may have other spinal metaastases to be treated as per the radiation oncologist's discretion, but the eligible spinal metastatic site has to be one where there is pain and no more than 3 consecutive segments to be included as clinical target volume and appropriate for either 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 24 Gy in 2 fractions per the randomization.
* There is no plan to change the pain medication on the first day of protocol treatment with radiotherapy.
* ECOG Performance Status 0-2.
* Seen by a radiation oncologist and judged to be appropriate for participation in this study including ability to tolerate protocol radiotherapy (SBRT or CRT).
* Age of 18 years or older.
* Patient is able and willing to complete the Patient Diary (pain and analgesic use).
* Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaire in either English or French. The baseline assessment must be completed within required timelines, prior to randomization. Inability (illiteracy in English or French, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible.
* Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate.
* Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.
* In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 3 weeks of patient randomization. From the time of successful treatment planning, no more than 12 days can elapse before the first fraction of radiotherapy is delivered.
* Women/men of childbearing potential must have agreed to use a highly effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of ""childbearing potential"" if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, ""effective contraception"" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures.
* Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test to determine eligibility as part of the Pre-Study Evaluation; this may include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy if a false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG, as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is negative for pregnancy.

Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of malignant melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

Advanced urothelial cancer has no cure. But only a few chemotherapy drugs have been tested for it. The Co-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) model predicts if cells respond to treatment. It may also help determine which drugs fight urothelial cancer based on the characteristics of a tumor. Researchers want to test if this model can choose the best therapy for advanced urothelial cancer within 3 weeks and how tumors respond to the next best therapy.

Objective:

To test if the COXEN model can choose the best therapy for advanced urothelial cancer within 3 weeks.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older whose urothelial cancer has spread after at least 1 line of chemotherapy

Design:

Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, and tumor scans.

Participants will provide a tumor sample from a previous surgery and a new biopsy. A needle will remove a small piece of tumor.

Participants will repeat screening tests, plus have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and scan. For the scan, they will get an injection of radioactive drug. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures.

Participants will take the drugs assigned by the COXEN model. They will have visits every 2-3 weeks. These will include blood and urine tests.

Participants will have tumor scans every 8-9 weeks.

Participants may have another biopsy.

Participants will take the drugs until they can't tolerate the side effects or their cancer worsens. They may be assigned to a second COXEN therapy.

Participants will have a follow-up visit 4-5 weeks after their last drug dose.

Participants will be contacted by phone every few months until death.","Urothelial Carcinoma, Bladder Cancer, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, ","75 approved agents, COXEN, ","Percentage of Participants Who Enrolled and Underwent a Biopsy Who Went on to Receive Treatment Within 21 Days, ",cancer,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, "

A rehabilitation method to prevent or reverse the systemic metabolic consequences of SCI is a pressing need. The purpose of this study is to determine the dose of muscle activity that can enhance an oxidative muscle phenotype and improve clinical markers of metabolic health and bone turnover in patients with SCI. The long-term goal of this research is to develop exercise-based interventions to prevent secondary health conditions such as diabetes and to ultimately protect health-related quality of life (QOL). Specific Aim 1: To compare changes in skeletal muscle gene regulation in individuals who receive high frequency (HF) active-resisted stance and low frequency (LF) active-resisted stance for 3 years. Hypothesis 1: The expression of genes regulating skeletal muscle metabolism will support that HF and LF both instigate a shift toward an oxidative muscle phenotype. A novel finding will be that LF is a powerful regulator of oxidative pathways in skeletal muscle. Specific Aim 2: To compare changes in systemic markers of metabolic health and bone turnover in individuals with SCI who receive HF or LF for 3 years. Hypothesis 2: HF and LF will both reduce glucose/insulin levels and HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) score.

Secondary Aim: To measure subject-reported QOL using the EQ-5D survey metric. Hypothesis 3: HF and LF subjects will show a trend toward improved self-reported QOL after 3 years. There will be an association between metabolic improvement and improved perception of QOL. These observations will support that this intervention has strong feasibility for future clinical translation.","Spinal Cord Injuries, ","Single-session electrically induced exercise, Electrically-induced exercise training, ","Acute Gene Regulation: MSTN, Acute Gene Regulation: PGC1-alpha, Acute Gene Regulation: PDK4, Acute Gene Regulation: SDHB, Post-training Gene Regulation: MSTN, Post-training Gene Regulation: PGC1-alpha, Post-training Gene Regulation: PDK4, Post-training Gene Regulation: SDHB, Post-training Metabolism: Fasting Glucose, Post-training Metabolism: Fasting Insulin, Post-training Metabolism: HOMA Score, Post-training Bone Turnover: Osteocalcin, ",diabetes,"Age, Categorical, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Quadriplegia versus Paraplegia, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Quadriplegia versus Paraplegia`, "

Any other conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence or compliance or possibility, hinder completion of the study.","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease that resembles alcoholic hepatitis but occurs in persons who drink little or no alcohol. The etiology of NASH is unclear, but it is commonly associated with diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. Several pilot studies, including a study of pioglitazone at the NIH Clinical Center (01-DK-0130), have shown that the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones lead to decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and improved liver histology. Once therapy is stopped, however, ALT levels rapidly return to pre-treatment values. Inaddition we are currently enrolling patients with NASH in a pilot study of metformin therapy for 48-weeks, however our results in 3 patients thus far have not been very encouraging.

In the current study, patients who have completed the pilot study of pioglitazone and have been off therapy for 48 weeks will be offered re-treatment for 3 years. We also propose to treat patients who have not had a satisfactory response to metformin with pioglitazone for the same duration. After a repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy, patients with moderate-to-severe NASH (activity score greater than or equal to 4) will restart pioglitazone at a dose of 15 mg daily. If after 48 weeks, ALT levels are not normal or improved to the degree identified during the pilot study, the dose will be increased to 30 mg daily at the end of 3 years, all patients will undergo repeat medical and metabolic evaluation and liver biopsy. The primary end point will be improvement in liver histology. Secondary end points will be improvements in insulin sensitivity, reduction in visceral fat, liver volume, and liver biochemistry. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether long-term pioglitazone therapy can safely achieve and maintain biochemical and histological improvements in NASH.

* A potential participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:

  1. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis (including placement of fistula if performed in preparation for dialysis) or kidney transplant.
  2. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and glycemic control).
  3. Initiation of intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) within 4 months prior to randomization or plans to do so in the next 4 months.

  21. History of intraocular corticosteroid treatment within 4 months prior to current vitreous hemorrhage onset or after onset.
  22. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery other than vitrectomy anticipated within the next 6 months following randomization.

  27. Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or substantial blepharitis.","Although vitreous hemorrhage (VH) from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can cause acute and dramatic vision loss for patients with diabetes, there is no current, evidence-based clinical guidance as to what treatment method is most likely to provide the best visual outcomes once intervention is desired. Intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy alone or vitrectomy combined with intraoperative PRP each provide the opportunity to stabilize or regress retinal neovascularization. However, clinical trials are lacking to elucidate the relative time frame of visual recovery or final visual outcome in prompt vitrectomy compared with initial anti-VEGF treatment. The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocol N demonstrated short-term trends consistent with a possible beneficial effect of anti-VEGF treatment in eyes with VH from PDR, including greater visual acuity improvement and reduced rates of recurrent VH as compared with saline injection. It is possible that a study with a longer duration of follow-up with structured anti-VEGF retreatment would demonstrate even greater effectiveness of anti-VEGF for VH to avoid vitrectomy and its attendant adverse events while also improving visual acuity. On the other hand, advances in surgical techniques leading to faster operative times, quicker patient recovery, and reduced complication rates may make prompt vitrectomy a more attractive alternative since it results in the immediate ability to clear hemorrhage and to perform PRP if desired, often as part of one procedure. This proposed study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two treatment approaches for eyes with VH from PDR: prompt vitrectomy + PRP and intravitreous aflibercept injections.","Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy, Vitreous Hemorrhage, ","2-mg Intravitreous Aflibercept Injection, Prompt Vitrectomy Plus Panretinal Photocoagulation, ","E-ETDRS Visual Acuity Letter Score (Area Under the Curve From Baseline), ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Diabetes Type, Duration of Diabetes, Insulin Used, Hemoglobin A1c, Mean Arterial Blood Pressure, Prior Myocardial Infarction, Prior Stroke, Kidney Disease, Body Mass Index, Daily Cigarette Smoking, Prior Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema, Prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic macular edema, Prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic retinopathy, Prior panretinal photocoagulation, Approximate Duration of Vitreous Hemorrhage, Lens Status on Clinical Exam, E-ETDRS visual acuity letter score, Traction Retinal Detachment, Macula Not Threatened, Intraocular Pressure, Prior focal/grid laser for Diabetic Macular Edema, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Diabetes Type`, `Duration of Diabetes`, `Insulin Used`, `Hemoglobin A1c`, `Mean Arterial Blood Pressure`, `Prior Myocardial Infarction`, `Prior Stroke`, `Kidney Disease`, `Body Mass Index`, `Daily Cigarette Smoking`, `Prior Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema`, `Prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic macular edema`, `Prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic retinopathy`, `Prior panretinal photocoagulation`, `Approximate Duration of Vitreous Hemorrhage`, `Lens Status on Clinical Exam`, `E-ETDRS visual acuity letter score`, `Traction Retinal Detachment, Macula Not Threatened`, `Intraocular Pressure`, `Prior focal/grid laser for Diabetic Macular Edema`, "

Structured lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in these at-risk populations and now are widely offered at community organizations and health systems. Yet, uptake of and engagement in available formal programs is very low. Low-income adults in particular face multiple barriers to navigating, engaging in, and sustaining involvement in available programs and lifestyle behaviors found to decrease progression to diabetes. It is critically important to develop and evaluate innovative approaches to increase uptake, engagement, and maintenance of gains in diabetes prevention activities. Peer support has been shown in the investigators' and others' effectiveness trials to be a sustainable, effective approach for positive behavior change and improved outcomes in adults with diabetes and other chronic conditions. The study team's pilot work suggests such approaches are feasible and acceptable among low-income Latino and African American patients with prediabetes to prevent chronic disease and better navigate their health care systems to obtain healthy lifestyle counseling and support. However, such peer support models among Latino, African American, and other low-income adults with prediabetes have not yet been rigorously evaluated. Accordingly, the study will conduct a parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial in primary care centers in two different health systems that serve multi-ethnic communities with a high concentration of Latinos and African Americans and diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The study will compare enhanced usual care (providing referrals to diabetes prevention programs and resources) with a model of a structured behavioral change intervention supplementing enhanced referral to programs and resources with peer support to help link adults with prediabetes to existing health system and community diabetes prevention programs, to support their engagement in formal programs, maintain achieved gains, and support participants to initiate and sustain healthy behaviors to prevent diabetes.","PreDiabetes, ","Peer Support, Enhanced Usual Care, ","Change in Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 Months, Change in Body Weight at 6 Months, ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Highest Education Level, Annual Household Income, Self-Rated Health, Food Insecure, Low Health Literacy, Properties of Neighborhood, Major Depressive Disorder Likely, Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Body Weight, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Highest Education Level`, `Annual Household Income`, `Self-Rated Health`, `Food Insecure`, `Low Health Literacy`, `Properties of Neighborhood`, `Major Depressive Disorder Likely`, `Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)`, `Body Weight`, "

This has led to the marketing of smaller gauge lancets, lancing devices with variable depth settings and blood glucose sensors that require less blood for measurement.

In this study, two main outcomes were evaluated: The first, which was assessed at Visit 1, was whether specific combinations of lancets and lancing devices would yield sufficient blood volume to allow valid assessment of diabetic subjects' glucose levels. The other outcome, assessed at Visit 2, was the level of pain perceived by subjects during lancing with specific combinations of lancets and lancing devices. During Visit 2, pain assessment was done using a Visual Analog Scale and such that for each lancet/lancing device, the lowest lancing device setting that yielded a valid BG reading for each subject during Visit 1 was used. A third outcome measure, overall comfort with lancing, was also assessed at Visit 2.

A total of 5 combinations of lancets and lancing devices were evaluated.

These were as follows:

* BD/33G = BD Lancet device/BD 33G lancets (BGM measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)
* OTM/33G =OneTouch® Mini Lancet device / BD 33G lancet (BGM measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)
* OTM/28G =OneTouch® Mini Lancet device / OneTouch® UltraSoft® 28G Lancet (BGM measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)
* OTU/28G = OneTouch® UltraSoft® Lancet device/OneTouch® UltraSoft® 28G Lancet (BGM measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)
* ACC/28G= Accu-Chek® Softclix Lancet device/Accu-Chek® Softclix 28G Lancet (BGM measured with Accu-Chek® Advantage BGM and Accu-Chek® Comfort Curve test strip)

Hypoglycemia is a common reason for admission to hospital for older patients with diabetes. Older patients are often unaware that their blood sugar is low and asymptomatic hypoglycemia, as assessed by continuous blood sugar monitoring, is frequent in the elderly. There is also evidence that older people with diabetes are more likely to develop cardiovascular events such a heart attack and more likely to die suddenly when compared to older people without diabetes. It is possible that low blood sugar levels contribute to the increased frequency of these events, but this possibility has never been studied. The purpose of this study is to assess how frequently low blood sugar occurs in older patients with diabetes and to see if low blood sugars adversely affect heart function in these patients.","Hypoglycemia, Type 2 Diabetes, ","iPro2 glucose sensor attachment, ","Number of Participants With Hypoglycemia (Blood Sugar Level <70 mg/dl, ",diabetes,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Subjects with type 2 diabetes over age 70, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Subjects with type 2 diabetes over age 70`, "

* Metabolic syndrome is a name given to a group of factors that tend to occur together. These risk factors include central obesity (extra weight around the middle of the body) and high blood pressure and blood sugar levels. They also include low levels of HDL (""good cholesterol"") and high triglyceride levels. A person is said to have metabolic syndrome if they have three or more of the above risk factors. People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
* Cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, is an important regulator of metabolism. People with central obesity and metabolic syndrome may have higher than normal cortisol levels that the body cannot regulate properly. Abnormal cortisol levels may play an important role in metabolic syndrome. Mifepristone is a drug that blocks cortisol. Researchers are interested in studying its effects on metabolic syndrome.

Objectives:

- To study the effects of short-term mifepristone treatment for metabolic syndrome.

Eligibility:

- Men and Women between 35 and 70 years of age are overweight or obese, and have abnormal glucose and triglyceride levels.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests.
* Participants will be admitted to the metabolic unit at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for the first 3 days of the study:
* Day 1: Body measurements (height, weight, waist, hip, and neck) and blood pressure tests. Also, 24 hours of regular blood draws and 24-hour urine collection to monitor regular daily cortisol levels.
* Day 2: Glucose/insulin infusion test to measure blood sugar levels.
* Day 3: Infusion of cortisol-like compounds and then regular blood draws for about 3 hours to evaluate how cortisol is metabolized.
* At the end of Day 3, participants will receive mifepristone or a look-alike capsule to take for 7 days at home.
* After 7 days, participants will return to the metabolic unit to repeat the Day 1 and Day 2 study procedures. They will continue to take mifepristone.
* One week after the second set of study tests, participants will return for a brief physical exam and blood tests.
* The study procedures will be repeated after 6 to 8 weeks, with the other study drug.","Endocrine Disease, Diabetes, ","Mifepristone, Placebo, ","Change in Insulin Sensitivity Index, ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Weight, Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, A1C, Urine free cortisol, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Weight`, `Body mass index`, `systolic blood pressure`, `diastolic blood pressure`, `total cholesterol`, `HDL cholesterol`, `LDL cholesterol`, `triglycerides`, `free fatty acids`, `fasting glucose`, `fasting insulin`, `A1C`, `Urine free cortisol`, "

10. Subject has HLA DQA1\*0102, DQB1\*0602 haplotype.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system (the part of the body which helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin (islet cells found in the pancreas). As these cells are destroyed, the body's ability to produce insulin decreases. There is evidence suggesting that repeated oral administration of an autoantigen (the same protein that the immune system is reacting to) may introduce a protective immunity and cause the immune system to stop its attack. An earlier, large scale study was done to see if oral insulin could delay or prevent the development of Type 1 diabetes in relatives at risk for developing Type 1 diabetes. The overall results showed that for the entire study population, oral insulin did not delay or prevent Type 1 diabetes. However, an analysis that was done after the conclusion of the trial suggested a potential beneficial effect in a subgroup of participants. The participants who seemed to benefit from oral insulin had higher levels of insulin autoantibodies which are directed against insulin itself ( called mIAA).

The Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet study group will further explore the potential role of oral insulin to delay or prevent Type 1 diabetes in a similar group of people. The study will also include a secondary group of individuals at different levels of risk than those in the primary cohort to gather information for future studies.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, ","Oral Insulin, Placebo, ","Rate of Type 1 Diabetes Per Year Among Individuals in the Primary Stratum When Treated With Oral Inulin Versus Placebo, ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Stratum, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Stratum`, "

Primary care providers (PCPs) often fail to identify medication nonadherence and/or have insufficient time and training to address underlying reasons for it. In this project, we propose a patient-centered and technology-driven strategy to identify patients with adherence issues and apply a team approach to help them achieve evidence-based personalized goals for glucose, blood pressure, or lipids. This intervention extends the use of a widely available clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to support a model of care that, for the first time outside of a fully integrated care environment, will integrate pharmacists within the primary care team. The intervention relies on a continuous health informatics loop to do the following: (a) identify high-risk patients with adherence problems at the point of care by expanding the capability of an electronic medical record (EMR)-linked CDS to identify poor adherence to medications; (b) establish and maintain an auto-populating up-to-date registry of patients identified for proactive pharmacist outreach; (c) implement a pharmacist outreach strategy based on an information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) framework recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) with demonstrated ability to influence adherence across a variety of clinical applications; and (d) coordinate care and adherence information by incorporating pharmacist assessment and action plans into CDS at subsequent office encounters.","Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension, Diabetes, Medication Nonadherence, ","Adherence Intervention, ","Blood Pressure Medication Adherence, Non-Insulin Glycemic Medication Adherence, Statin Medication Adherence, Mean Change in Systolic Blood Pressure, Mean Change in A1c, ",diabetes,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD)`, "

In addition, the population of obese older Veterans is rapidly increasing as more baby boomers become senior citizens. In older Veterans, obesity exacerbates the age- related decline in physical function and causes frailty which predisposes to admission to a VA chronic care facility. However, the optimal clinical approach to obesity in older adults is controversial because of the concern that weight loss therapy could be harmful by aggravating the age-related loss of muscle mass and bone mass. In fact, the MOVE (Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any guidelines for eligible Veterans if they are 70 or older. It is possible that the addition of testosterone replacement to lifestyle therapy will preserve muscle mass and bone mass and reverse frailty in obese older Veterans and thus prevent their loss of independence and decrease demand for VA health care services.","Obesity and Hypogonadism, ","Testosterone, Lifestyle Therapy, Placebo, ","Change in the Physical Performance Test, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, Body mass index, Total testosterone level, Physical Performance Test score, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Body mass index`, `Total testosterone level`, `Physical Performance Test score`, "
NCT04142034,Feasibility Trial of the iAMHealthy Intervention,"Inclusion Criteria:

1. Child is rural. The child lives in a rural area, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (greater than or equal to 4). We will calculate this using the 2010 Zip Code, RUCA Code crosswalk.
2. Child is ages 6-11 years at the time of consent. At the time of consent, a child must be 6 to 11 years of age. A narrow age range is necessary to decrease developmental variability. Clinics may enroll a child no earlier than her or his sixth birthday (6 years, 0 months, 0 days), and may enroll a child up to her or his 12th birthday (11 years, 11 months, 30 days).
3. Child BMI percentile is ≥85th. We will use the 85th percentile as a minimal cutoff for participation, as this is the minimal criteria for the definition of overweight. There is no upper limit on BMI percentile for inclusion.
4. Child and primary caregiver speak English. For the initial feasibility pilot, we will ask that both the child and primary caregiver speak English. For the larger trial that will follow, we will accommodate Spanish-speaking participants.
5. For the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention arm, the child and primary caregiver are available when the behavioral intervention team offers the intervention for the participating clinic. The child and primary caregiver must be available for most of the iAmHealthy behavioral intervention sessions when the behavioral intervention psychologist/social worker offers the group sessions at the participants' clinic. The behavioral team will conduct these sessions via video conference and families will attend via tablets.

   -

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Child has a physical limitation or injury that substantially limits physical mobility or has a planned medical treatment during the course of the trial that will substantially limit physical mobility. Because this trial recommends physical activity, we will exclude children who cannot comply with this health behavior.
2. Child has a known medical issue that could affect protocol compliance (e.g., cancer). If a child has a significant medical issue known to the clinic that could affect protocol compliance, we will exclude this child, as the protocol involves an intense intervention commitment.
3. Child and/or primary caregiver has a developmental delay or cognitive impairment that could affect protocol compliance. We will exclude primary caregivers and/or children with a known developmental delay, as this could negatively affect participation and measurement completion.
4. Child is enrolled in a weight-loss trial. If a child is enrolled in a weight-loss trial, we will exclude the child to avoid cross-pollination of trial interventions.
5. Child has a sibling who has already enrolled in the trial. If multiple children from the same family attempt to enroll, the statistical team will randomly select one child for enrollment. We will always allow siblings to attend the intervention, but we will not officially enroll them.","This research study is being done to find out which of 2 ways works best to get rural participants interested in joining a research study about children who weigh more than is considered healthy. One method researchers will use is the traditional method of reaching out to potential participants. The traditional method includes using flyers, posters, and booklets. The other method will be to target people who might be especially interested in the study. The second method uses medical records to find potential participants who are most likely to qualify for the study. This study is also being done to what works to help keep participants in a study like this.

Another goal of the study is to find out what methods work well to help get and keep children's and caregiver's weight in the healthy range. Researchers also want to see what works well to help children with a high Body Mass Index be more physically active and to eat healthier foods. The test methods researchers will use for this part of the study are (1) newsletters only and (2) newsletters plus online meetings. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 groups (newsletter or newsletter plus meetings.)

The newsletter-only group will receive monthly newsletters about children's health; this group will receive these letters for 6 months. The 'newsletter plus meeting group' will also receive the same monthly newsletter for 6 months. The latter group will also have online meetings with other children and adults as well as a group leader. Those in the 'newsletter plus meeting group' will also individually meet with a dietician.

This study will involve children and one of their caregivers (parent/guardian). The child and caregiver must live in a rural area. The child must be 6 to 11 years old. The child must be considered to have an unhealthy weight (high Body Mass Index). Both the child and caregiver must speak English. Up to 224 children will enter into this study.

The ability to self-regulate energy intake (eating when hungry and stopping when full) is vital to obesity prevention and it is thought that this ability can be derailed by a chronic mismatch between parental feeding behavior and the infant's state (feeding in the absence of hunger and/or feeding beyond fullness).

* hypothalamic obesity","Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in obese youth. In our obese population followed in the Endocrinology clinic at Children's Medical Center Dallas, vitamin D levels were inversely correlated with a measure of insulin resistance. We propose to show that correction of vitamin D levels in obese children and adolescents improves their insulin sensitivity. Obese youth presenting to the Center for Obesity and its Consequences on Health (COACH) clinic will be randomized to receive either the most recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations of minimum D3 dose of 600 IU/day (1), or receive higher doses of D3 such that the blood levels of vitamin D will be brought to a target level in either the low part or high part of the normal range. The goal is to determine if correction of vitamin D deficiency will improve insulin sensitivity in this group. Secondary goals include determining whether correction of vitamin D deficiency in obese adolescents and children results in less weight gain, and determining the amount of D3 required to correct vitamin D levels in this population.

Our specific hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis #1 Obese youth treated with Vitamin D3 who achieve low-normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (OHD) levels (30-50 ng/mL) or high-normal 25-OHD levels (60-80 ng/mL) will have improved insulin resistance, as measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), compared to those individuals with deficient 25-OHD levels (\< 30 ng/mL).

Hypothesis #2 Subjects with a higher BMI will have higher Vitamin D dose requirements than current IOM recommendations of 600 IU/day and will take a longer period of time to reach target 25-OHD levels.

Hypothesis #3 Subjects with normal 25-OHD levels will demonstrate less weight gain compared to subjects on the control arm.","Obesity, Insulin Resistance, Vitamin D Deficiency, ","Vitamin D3, ","Change in HOMA-IR, ",obesity,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, "

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Patients with secondary causes of obesity especially genetic syndromes e.g. Trisomy 21, Prader-Willi
2. Currently participating in a weight management program
3. Unable to understand and speak English sufficiently to give informed consent and complete the research assessments.","Background: The Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recommends a staged based approach to the management of adolescents with overweight and obesity from Stage 1-4 with increasing intensity of management in higher stages. Mobile health application is an attractive community based treatment for adolescent obesity due to its wide penetration and convenience. Early weight loss has been found to be the strongest predictor of good long term outcome in obesity. However there is currently no known study that use early weight loss as a predictor factor for a stepped up approach using a mobile health application.

Clinical significance: The current study use a mobile health intervention to identify participants with early weight loss in a stepped up approach.

Primary objective will be to examine the proportion of patients triaged to the low risk Weight Management Clinics (WMC) after brief intervention by a nurse coordination and completion of 4 sessions of Kurbo Program over a 12 month recruitment period.

Secondary objectives will be to examine changes in BMI z-score, metabolic profile, examine program feasibility and fidelity and explore other predictors of poor response to program.

Methodology:

Children aged 13-17 years old with BMI percentile of above 90th percentile, who are referred to the WMC, will receive a brief intervention by the WMC nurse coordinator followed by introduction to Kurbo program, a multifunctional mobile application, for more detailed dietary and physical activity recommendations and implementation of behavioural changes. Patients that are able to engage with Kurbo intervention and showed a decrease in BMI percentile over 4 sessions of Kurbo will be offered the low risk weight management clinic.

At baseline, month 3 and month 6, the patient's weight and height, body fat composition, waist circumference and blood pressure will be measured as per usual standard protocol. Questionnaires to assess eating, quality of life and dietary recall will be administered as part of the research. Accelerometers will also be fitted to assess physical activity.

At baseline and month 6, metabolic blood tests (HbA1C, fasting lipid panel, oral glucose tolerance test, fasting insulin level and liver function test) were collected after a minimum 8 hour fasting period together with bloods for aromatic amino acid, branch chain amino acid and long chain acylcarnitines .

Current low risk WMC patients will be offered 2 monthly follow up with optional dietician and exercise physiologists counselling and exercise sessions. The high risk WMC patients will be routinely offered the standard high risk follow up protocol consisting of weekly follow up with the multidisciplinary team for 4 weeks followed by 2 weekly appointments for 2 months and monthly appointment thereafter based on clinical response.","Adolescent Obesity, ","Mobile health intervention, ","Proportion of Patients Triaged to the Low Risk Weight Management Clinics, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race (NIH/OMB), Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Body Mass Index z scores, Body Mass, Height, Body Mass Index, Waist-height ratio, Body fat percentage, Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Body Mass Index z scores`, `Body Mass`, `Height`, `Body Mass Index`, `Waist-height ratio`, `Body fat percentage`, `Systolic blood pressure`, `Diastolic blood pressure`, "

This results in posterior spread of local anesthetic through the middle layer of the thoraco-lumbar fascia, which theoretically communicates with the paravertebral space resulting in potentially longer-lasting and denser analgesia than wound infiltration. The QL 2 block derives from the TAP block, which is also a fascial plane block that is commonly used to treat pain following surgery involving the anterior abdominal wall. However, the QL block's more posterior location has recently been shown to provide a longer lasting and more profound analgesic effect than the TAP block, possibly by communicating with the paravertebral space. Although the TAP has been shown to be effective in a variety of surgical procedures involving an anterior abdominal wall incision including laparoscopic bariatric surgery the QL 2 block has until now, not been studied in the context of bariatric surgery.","Morbid Obesity, High BMI, ","Bupivacaine, ","The Amount of Opioid Consumption During and After Procedure, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race and Ethnicity Not Collected, Body Mass Index (BMI), Existence of preexisting pain, Pre Non-analgesic Meds, Pre Analgesic Meds, Recreational drug use, Preop Systolic Blood Pressure (BP), Preop Diastolic BP, Preop Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Preop Heart Rate (HR), Preop Respiratory Rate (RR), Preop Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race and Ethnicity Not Collected`, `Body Mass Index (BMI)`, `Existence of preexisting pain`, `Pre Non-analgesic Meds`, `Pre Analgesic Meds`, `Recreational drug use`, `Preop Systolic Blood Pressure (BP)`, `Preop Diastolic BP`, `Preop Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)`, `Preop Heart Rate (HR)`, `Preop Respiratory Rate (RR)`, `Preop Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)`, "

The pilot study translated and tailored the Look Ahead weight loss intervention to an overweight/obese active duty U.S. Air Force population, while accommodating the lifestyle and environment that is unique to military members and evaluate materials and procedures used.

Rationale: Being overweight is now by far the leading medical reason for rejection in the military. Unfortunately, the impact of weight problems on the military does not stop with those turned away from military service. From 1998 to 2008, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center reported the percent of active military members who experienced medical encounters for overweight or obesity significantly increased. The estimated total days of work lost from absenteeism associated with active-duty personnel who are overweight or obese was 658,000. Using Department of Defense (DOD) estimates of average daily based, it was estimated that overweight and obesity costs the DOD $103 million dollars in health care costs annually. Note this estimate is for active duty personnel only. Furthermore, obesity is a major cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.

The current study is inspired by the successful Look Ahead trial, a behavioral science obesity intervention treatment program that included: a collaborative approach, education, behavioral support, and motivational interviewing. The unique nature of this weight reduction study is significant. To our knowledge, there had not been a successful translation of a highly efficacious obesity treatment in the military until The University of Tennessee Health Science Center implemented a pilot version of the Fit Blue program for active duty U.S. Air Force members in 2013. Following a successful pilot and extant results from the Look Ahead trial, Investigators expect success during the full scale Fit Blue study.","Overweight, Obesity, ","Phone-based sessions (28 total) on a structured schedule, Phone-based sessions upon request, Weight self-monitoring, Dietary and physical activity self-monitoring, Scheduled tailored interventionist feedback, Dietary goals, Meal replacements, Physical activity goals, Toolbox, Challenges, Tailored interventionist feedback upon request, ","Percent Weight Loss (Baseline to 12 Months), ",obesity,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Weight, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Weight`, "

* Previous randomisation for treatment in the present study","Assessing the safety and effectiveness of a 11-βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitor (AZD4017), in a placebo controlled trial, in acute idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) IIH is a condition of young, overweight women with characteristic raised intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) leading to papilloedema (swelling of the nerve supplying the eye), visual loss and headaches. Medical literature (Cochrane review) demonstrates there is little evidence for the treatments used for IIH. Weight control appears the most effective method of improving symptoms but weight loss is difficult to maintain. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) is an enzyme which regulates local steroid levels and our previous research suggests it may influence the production of brain fluid(cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). 11β-HSD1 levels fall with weight loss and this is associated with with decreased intracranial pressure.

Our primary outcome is to determine whether AZD4017, an inhibitor of 11β-HSD1, will reduce the pressure in the brain and as a consequence improve IIH. Patients are eligible to enter the study if they are between 18-55 years old with acute (\<6 months) IIH, signs of active disease (papilloedema and raised CSF pressure (\>25 cmH20)), no other major illnesses and have no plans for pregnancy during the study period.

This is an MRC funded single centre, phase II, double-blinded, randomised control drug trial. It will be conducted at the University Hospital Birmingham and the University of Birmingham will act as Sponsor. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to AZD4017 or a placebo ('dummy' with no active drug) for 3 months with a follow up a month later. Investigations during the study will include bloods, urine samples, pregnancy tests, lumbar punctures, DXA scans and small fat/skin biopsies. Participants will benefit from increased monitoring and a potential improvement in their condition.

We hypothesise that specific inhibition of 11β-HSD1 will decrease intracranial pressure and consequently treat patients with IIH, thus opening a new and entirely novel therapeutic avenue.","Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, ","AZD4017, Placebo, ","Intracranial Pressure, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, Taking acetazolamide (yes/no), Opening LP pressure (cmCSF), Weight (kg), BMI (kg/m^2), Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT-6) Score, Frisen grading (Worst eye), Presence of Pulsatile Tinnitus, Presence of visual loss, Presence of diplopia, Presence of Visual obscuration, Presence of headache, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Taking acetazolamide (yes/no)`, `Opening LP pressure (cmCSF)`, `Weight (kg)`, `BMI (kg/m^2)`, `Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT-6) Score`, `Frisen grading (Worst eye)`, `Presence of Pulsatile Tinnitus`, `Presence of visual loss`, `Presence of diplopia`, `Presence of Visual obscuration`, `Presence of headache`, "

Nearly 80% of African American women are overweight or obese in the United States. Hypertension and insulin resistance are more prevalent among African American women as compared to men and Caucasians. These conditions put them at increased risk for the development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

Recent studies have reported that a substance named Nitric Oxide (NO)may have some beneficial effect on how the body handles blood sugar and blood pressure. Of interest,some studies have shown that African Americans have decreased function of NO in their blood vessels.

In this study proposal the investigators will test if increasing NO function with a PDE-5 inhibitor (sildenafil citrate) will improve pre-diabetes and the health of the inner layer of the blood vessels in obese African American women.","Metabolic Syndrome, Obesity, ","Sildenafil, Placebo, ","Insulin Sensitivity, ",obesity,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Height, Weight, Body mass index, Waist circumference, HDL, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Body mass index`, `Waist circumference`, `HDL`, `triglycerides`, `glucose`, `insulin`, "

Obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) \> 40 or BMI \>35 with a co-morbidity will be eligible.

Exclusion Criteria:Subjects will be excluded if they have evidence of vitamin D deficiency (\< 20 ng/mL), hypercalcemia (calcium \> 2.63 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (calcium \< 1.75 mmol/L), renal insufficiency (GFR \< 50 ml/min), or a history of primary hyperparathyroidism or renal tubular acidosis.Participants will be excluded if they take medications that interfere with vitamin D metabolism, have significant sun exposure, plan to travel to sunny climates during the study, or a history of hypercalcemia.

-","As the use of bariatric surgery for treatment of extreme obesity adults continues to rise, clinicians must be aware of pre-existing nutritional deficiencies in overweight and obese patients. Nutritional deficiencies are common in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and these deficiencies should be detected and addressed early to avoid post-operative complications. To improve long-term outcomes following bariatric surgery, nutritional screening and prescribing appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies is needed. Vitamin D deficiency is common following bariatric surgery and has been reported to occur in 50-80% bariatric patients.The goal of this pilot study is to help develop nutrient supplementation interventions following two types of bariatric surgery: Roux-en Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.

Recently, several studies in adults have revealed an inverse relationship between body fat and blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 \[25(OH)D\] levels, the relevant marker of low vitamin D status. Although vitamin D is well known for its essential role in bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis, increasing evidence is linking vitamin D to obesity. This study will evaluate vitamin D status during post operative daily supplementation of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg of calcium through assessment of changes in serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks following surgery. The dietary contribution of vitamin D and calcium will be estimated by food records analyzed using the University of Minnesota 2010 Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) program.

Primary Hypothesis: Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks will significantly increase mean serum 25(OH)D levels in obese subjects following bariatric surgery compared to baseline levels.

Secondary Hypothesis: The percent response above baseline to daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 will significantly differ between Roux-en Y and sleeve gastrectomy patients.","Obesity, Vitamin D Deficiency, ","Vitamin D3 and Calcium, ","Vitamin D Concentrations, Pre Operative and Post Bariatric Surgery Following 12 Weeks of Vitamin D Supplementation, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Region of Enrollment, BMI, kg/m^2, Body weight, lb, Excess body weight, lb, Surgery type, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Region of Enrollment`, `BMI, kg/m^2`, `Body weight, lb`, `Excess body weight, lb`, `Surgery type`, "

The VA currently offers an effective weight management program called MOVE!, but the majority of eligible patients do not attend. Veterans see their primary care providers (PCPs) very frequently, making it an important place to receive information on weight management. However, PCPs often fail to discuss weight management with patients, so interventions are needed to encourage weight management counseling within the team-based care model used in primary care at the VA. Investigators used focus groups, interviews, and other research methods to develop the MOVE! Toward Your Goals (MTG) intervention. This intervention combines online tools, counseling by a health coach, and the team-based care model to deliver weight management information to patients.

Investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 320 Veteran patients and their providers at two VA sites (Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses, New York Harbor Healthcare System) to study the impact of the 12-month MTG intervention when compared to Enhanced Usual Care. Veterans in the MTG intervention arm will take the MTG tool, receive personalized weight management materials, health coach counseling, and go to their scheduled primary care (PC) visit. After the initial visit, MTG-arm Veterans will receive follow up telephone coaching over 12 months. All Veterans will attend follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months to assess body mass index, diet and physical activity, and goal attainment.

The objectives of this study are to: (a) test the impact of the MTG intervention on weight and behavior changes; (b) identify predictors of weight loss in Veterans who use goal setting techniques; and (c) determine the impact of the MTG intervention on primary care team obesity-related counseling practices and attitudes.","Obesity, ","MOVE!

The study findings may lead to new strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes. In diabetes, blood sugar is higher than normal and can result in serious medical problems, such as blindness and kidney failure. People with subclinical inflammation-inflammation that does not produce symptoms, such as fever, pain, or skin redness-are at increased risk for diabetes. Although the reasons for this are not completely understood, it is known that subclinical inflammation exacerbates insulin resistance, which is a cause of diabetes. Insulin is a hormone that helps control blood sugar, and when it does not work properly, the condition is known as insulin resistance.

Normal, healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years old with a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2 and who have subclinical inflammation (determined by blood tests) may be eligible for this study.

We will use off the shelf, validated and wearable wireless sensors to measure physical activity, blood pressure, sleep, heart rate, galvanic skin response and blood glucose levels and communicate the measured information to a mobile phone using a wireless interface. This will deliver a record of behavior and health data that is time-stamped, synchronized, and geographically localized using GPS to a secure server. Data will then be analyzed and displayed to participating health professionals to provide them with readily interpretable records of continuously monitored energy expenditure, recorded and synchronized with other essential biological, behavioral and geographical data. To accomplish this project, 50 African American and Hispanic youth (50% female, ages 12-17) will be recruited into the research in advisory capacities, to test the sensors during development, and to wear the sensors for three non-contiguous weeks. To test the sensors prior to use with minority youth, 30 college students age 18 and above will be recruited to try out the sensors in and outside of the laboratory in order to make sure that all sensors are in perfect working order before testing them in minority youth populations. An advisory group of medical professionals will be assembled to guide us through the process of developing a web interface that will ensure that the right information will be displayed in an easily interpretable fashion. The advisory group will participate in regular meetings to develop and test the web interface.

A randomized controlled trial design is proposed to evaluate, among 600 Head Start children and their parents, the effectiveness of 2 approaches to obesity prevention: (1) the Parents of Preschoolers Prevention Series (POPS), a curriculum delivered to preschoolers and their parents focused on obesity-related health behaviors; and (2) POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an evidence-based program designed to improve preschoolers' emotional and behavioral self-regulation. The research objective is to test the hypotheses that: (1) POPS, compared to Usual Head Start exposure, will lead to greater improvements in obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices; and (2) POPS + IYS will lead to the greatest improvements in obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices, and this effect will be mediated by improved self-regulation. The extension objective is to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and educational effectiveness of the POPS and POPS + IYS interventions, as delivered by paraprofessionals and educators within Extension and Head Start.

* Any other condition in the opinion of the investigators that may impede successful data collection","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (or NASH) is known to be caused by deposition of fat in the liver and development of scarring. This condition occurs more frequently in overweight and obese persons. It is often associated with resistance to the actions of insulin hormone. Fat cells secrete a hormone called leptin. Recently, we have learned that obese or overweight persons make too much leptin, which may contribute to insulin resistance. Paradoxically, patients who do not have any fat cells, also have insulin resistance. In these patients, insulin resistance is caused by the absence of leptin and leptin replacement significantly improves insulin resistance and fat deposition in the liver. In an earlier study, we determined the leptin levels in patients with NASH and how these levels are related to body fat levels as well as responsiveness to insulin. We saw that a subgroup of patients with NASH have relatively low levels of leptin in contrast to the amount of body fat they had. We now would like to see if restoring leptin levels to normal will improve the disease process in these patients. Our study patients will be male patients, aged between 18 and 65 (inclusive), who do not have any other cause for their liver disease. We have put some restrictions in body size such that a spectrum of patients from normal weight to obese range would be included. They will also demonstrate low leptin levels (levels similar to only 25% of normal population). We will use a genetically engineered form of leptin manufactured by Amylin Inc. given via injections under the skin. We plan to continue therapy for a period of one year and evaluate the change in liver disease by a liver biopsy. We will also follow the metabolic parameters and body composition characteristics that we examined in our earlier study. We expect that patients with low blood leptin levels will show improvement in their liver disease and insulin resistance when their blood leptin levels are restored to normal.","Fatty Liver Disease, Nonalcoholic, ","metreleptin, ","Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Score as Determined by Liver Histopathology at 12 Months, ",obesity,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Region of Enrollment, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) score, Body Weight, Liver fat percentage by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI - Dixon method), Liver function test: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Liver function test: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Fasting glucose, Insulin Resistance: homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), Fasting triglycerides, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Region of Enrollment`, `Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) score`, `Body Weight`, `Liver fat percentage by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI - Dixon method)`, `Liver function test: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)`, `Liver function test: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)`, `Fasting glucose`, `Insulin Resistance: homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)`, `Fasting triglycerides`, "

There have been multiple reported complications associated with the BCP, including cerebral ischemia, loss of vision, ophthalmoplegia, stroke, and even death. It has been reported that patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 34 or greater are as much as 12 times more likely to experience cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) compared to non-obese controls. CDEs in the upright position are hypothesized to be partially related to reduced cardiac preload due to venous pooling in the lower extremities which is exaggerated in obese patients.

* Taking medication for weight loss","People with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder experience high rates of physical illness and die earlier than people without serious mental illness (WHO, 2005). Health differences seem to be worse among African Americans (Weber, Cowan, Millikan \& Niebuhr, 2009). High rates of obesity among this group contribute to health and wellness concerns (de Hert et al., 2011), with African American women at higher risk of obesity than men. Behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLIs) may promote diet and physical activity that lead to weight loss, but healthy food and safe physical activity options are less available in low-income neighborhoods. Peer navigators have been found to be effective in addressing health differences, and may help people living in low-income communities find healthy food and activity resources (Fischer, Sauaia, \& Kutner, 2007). In addition, traumatic experiences are common among persons with serious mental illness as well as African Americans, and may impact weight.

Through this project, investigators will test two interventions designed to address overweight and obesity among African Americans with serious mental illness. The first is a BWLI designed for persons with serious mental illness and adapted to meet the needs of African Americans. This program has 8-month intervention phase and 4-month maintenance phase. The intervention includes group weight management classes, group physical activity, individual visits to address barriers to meeting weight goals, and weigh-ins. The second intervention is a peer navigator program that assists people with serious mental illness in meeting their health needs in the community. Two-hundred and seventy (270) research participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: BWLI program, BWLI program plus peer navigator, and treatment as usual (integrated physical and mental health care). Investigators will evaluate these interventions over a 12-month period, and will track weight change, health behaviors, physical and mental health, recovery, and quality of life. Investigators also seek to understand the impact of gender and trauma on outcomes. Investigators hypothesize that peer navigators will improve outcomes over the BWLI program alone. Findings will advance knowledge and services to reduce racial disparities in obesity and comorbid health conditions for African Americans with serious mental illnesses.","Obesity, Mental Disorder, ","BWLI, BWLI & Peer Navigator, Integrated Care, ","Weight, ",obesity,"Age, Categorical, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Region of Enrollment, SF-36 Subscale: General Health, SF-36 Subscale: Bodily Pain, SF-36 Subscale: Physical Functioning, SF-36 Subscale: Emotional Well-Being, CES-D (Depression), RAS-R (Recovery), QLS (Quality of Life), WEL (Weight Efficacy Lifestyle), EES (Emotional Eating), Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Total, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors: Physical Activity Subscale, Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors: Diet Subscale, ","`Age, Categorical`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Region of Enrollment`, `SF-36 Subscale: General Health`, `SF-36 Subscale: Bodily Pain`, `SF-36 Subscale: Physical Functioning`, `SF-36 Subscale: Emotional Well-Being`, `CES-D (Depression)`, `RAS-R (Recovery)`, `QLS (Quality of Life)`, `WEL (Weight Efficacy Lifestyle)`, `EES (Emotional Eating)`, `Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Total`, `Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors: Physical Activity Subscale`, `Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors: Diet Subscale`, "

GDM is often the culmination of years of unrecognized and unmodified diabetes risk factors that lead to overt and occult clinical manifestations during pregnancy. Systematic reviews of older studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes (DM2) at rates much greater than control groups who did not have glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Liraglutide may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the beta -(ß-)cell function improvement in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models.

Clinically significant vascular disease is defined as any of the following occurring in the preceding three months: angina, claudication, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or decompensated heart failure. Furthermore, patients will be excluded if they have any history of ischemic colitis or Raynaud's disease.","The death rate of patients with endstage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis each year is 20%, with diseases related to the heart and blood vessels causing about half. About 60% of patients on hemodialysis have high blood pressure, which is poorly controlled in most. Normal blood pressure in these patients greatly improves the chance of living. Increased fluid in the body and bloodstream is a major cause of hypertension in patients with ESRD. Fluid removal during hemodialysis is often limited by symptoms of low blood pressure during the procedure. Therefore the increase in fluid and related high blood pressure is ongoing for many of these patients. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a hormone naturally produced by the body which has little effect on blood pressure in healthy people, but acts as a powerful vasoconstrictor (narrows the blood vessels) when blood pressure is threatened. Recent studies have shown when there is too little AVP, patients are more likely to have low blood pressure during dialysis that limits fluid removal, an effect that can be reversed by giving these patients low doses of AVP. This phase II trial will find out which of two doses of AVP (.15 or .30 mU kg-1 min-1), in combination with standard therapy, works best to change interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure after 2 weeks. Patients who enroll in this study will be divided into three groups. One group will be given a 0.15 mU kg-1 min-1 dose of AVP at each dialysis session over a 2-week period; the second group will be given AVP 0.3 mU kg-1 min-1 at the same interval; and a third group will be given normal saline (placebo) at the same interval.

Chronic kidney disease is defined by decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as classified by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO). Deterioration of kidney function has a complex and multifactorial pathophysiologic derangement. In order to counter kidney injury associated with cardiac surgery, several pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been studied to prevent perioperative deterioration of kidney function. Diuretics as pharmacologic measure are often used post-cardiac surgery to treat fluid overload and managing patient with acute kidney injury by preventing anuria. Loop diuretics (furosemide) may improve renal blood flow, decrease reabsorption in renal tubules, decrease oxygen demand and energy consumption (blocking potassium/sodium/2cloride co-transport in loop of Henle), and prevent hypoxic injury of renal medulla. Low dose continuous furosemide hypothetically has a protective effect on cardiac surgery patients with kidney dysfunction, measured improved glomerular filtration rate, decreased indication for therapeutic furosemide infusion, and decreased need of renal replacement therapy. On the other hand, administration of furosemide is rather harmful in severe kidney dysfunction.

Patients with HPT often have high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and may have large parathyroid glands in the neck. Patients with HPT can develop bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease can cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. Other problems from HPT may include increases in blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) and low blood levels of phosphorus (hypophosphatemia). The high calcium levels may cause calcium to deposit in body tissues. Calcium deposits can cause arthritis (joint pain and swelling), muscle inflammation, itching, gangrene (death of soft tissue), heart and lung problems or kidney transplant dysfunction (worsening of kidney transplant function).

NCT00098020,Podocyte Retinoids,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:
* Patients with podocyte diseases, MCD, FSGS (including primary, secondary, and adaptive variants), and CG (including HIV-associated variant), who meet the following criteria:

  --An adequate renal biopsy, defined as having minimum 10 glomeruli for light microscopy and minimum 3 glomeruli for electron microscopy, unless the podocyte disease is diagnostic on fewer glomeruli. Patients who have non-diagnostic or technically inadequate biopsies will be offered the opportunity to undergo a research biopsy to determine eligibility. For some patients who have had a non-diagnostic or technically inadequate biopsy, a repeat renal biopsy may be clinically indicated in an effort to diagnose and treat a potentially serious kidney disease.
* Greater than or equal to 16 years of age. The rationale for excluding younger children is that retinoids may carry greater toxicity in children, as there are reports of premature epiphyseal closure, development of slender long bones, and periostal thickening.
* Prior treatment with at least two immunosuppressive agents that have been shown to induce remission in MCD and FSGS: glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil. Therapy with each agent must last at least 8 weeks. Exemptions will be made for those with contraindications to these medications or those who cannot tolerate these medications. The rationale is to recruit patients who have failed conventional therapy. All patients will be off immunosuppression for at least 4 weeks before starting retinoids in order to avoid a confounding effect.
* Three first void urine protein/creatinine ratios \> 2 g/g obtained within one month prior to enrolling in the study. These urine collections will be obtained after the patient has been on a stable dose of angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for at least 4 weeks (the maximal antiproteinuric effect of these medications occurs after 4 weeks). The rationale is that patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria are at high risk for progressive renal disease, justifying participation in a clinical trial with novel agents. Patients with steroid-sensitive frequently relapsing MCD will not be required to have used ACE inhibitor or ARB, as steroids alone are typically sufficient therapy to induce remission.
* If hypertensive: blood pressure of less than or equal to 140/90 on a stable dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 1 month or greater than or equal to 75 percent of measurements before the entry of the study. The rationale is that uncontrolled hypertension can exacerbate proteinuria.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

* Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or unwillingness to use at least two contraceptive methods (at least one of which must be primary, including tubal ligation, partner vasectomy, oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, and intrauterine device). The rationale is that retinoids are teratogenic and are excreted in breast milk.
* Abnormal liver function test, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, or protime. The rationale is that retinoids can be hepatotoxic. The only exception will be the following: if the cause of abnormality of liver function tests (LFT) is felt to be due to a specific hepatotoxic drug such as a statin and the levels are less than 2 times the upper limit of the normal AND normalize upon holding the offending drug, patients may be considered for study participation after consultation with hepatology service.
* Hypertriglyceridemia greater than 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy. The rationale is that retinoids can increase lipids, particularly triglyceride as this can lead to pancreatitis.
* Any medical conditions requiring concurrent immunosuppression, as this pilot study is designed to evaluate the effect of retinoids as a monotherapy.
* Any medical conditions requiring concurrent use of tetracycline, minocycline, or doxycycline, due to enhanced risk of increased intracranial pressure.
* Hypersensitivity to retinoids.
* Presence of any unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes with hemoglobin A1c greater than 8 percent, chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions except HIV-1 infection. Retinoids have been associated with chest pain of unclear etiology, increased serum glucose, myelosuppression and increased risk of infection. The etiology of infection is not clear but may be related to myelosuppression.
* Those with HIV-1 infection must not have any evidence for opportunistic infectious complications and have cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count greater than or equal to 200. Both tretinoin and isotretinoin have been safely studied in HIV-infected patients for other indications.
* glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 40 ml/min/1.73m(2) estimated by 5-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, as the metabolites of retinoids are excreted in part in urine, and there is a concern for increased toxicity. In participants less than 18 years of age, we will use Schwartz equation.
* Expansion of glomerulus or interstitial formation on the biopsy.
* Untreated depression, as retinoids have been associated with depression, suicidal ideation, and aggressive behavior. If patients manifest significant depressive symptoms, they will be included in the study only if assessed and agreed by a psychiatrist (either at NIH or other) and if they have regular follow-up visits with a psychiatrist.
* Factors that increase the risk of renal biopsy. These include the following: unwillingness to accept blood transfusion, bleeding diathesis, single kidney, small kidneys (less than 9.5 cm).","This is a pilot study of retinoids for patients with unsatisfactory response to conventional treatment of nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or minimal change disease, two renal disorders associated with putatively pathogenic malfunctioning of glomerular podocytes. The hypothesis that retinoids may have reparative effects on these cells is based on previous research showing that retinoids promote the differentiation or redifferentiation of aberrant epithelial cells. Results obtained by 6 months of treatment with retinoids (that have been approved for non-renal indications) will be used as preliminary information upon which to base further testing of these agents in formal clinical trials in refractory cases of these nephrotic syndromes.","Collapsing Glomerulopathy, Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental, ","Isotretinoin, ","Change in Proteinuria at Week 24 From Baseline, ",chronic kidney disease,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race (NIH/OMB), Protein, Urine, Creatinine, Urine, Protein/Creatinine Ratio, Urine, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Protein, Urine`, `Creatinine, Urine`, `Protein/Creatinine Ratio, Urine`, "

* Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy in stages 3 and 4 (moderate and severe nephropathy, corresponding to glomerular filtration rate of 15-59 ml/min/1.73m²) will be included in the study.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients with systemic neoplasias,
* HIV, chronic kidney disease or nephropathy from other etiologies,
* severe psychiatric disorders
* pregnant women.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and it is the leading cause of end stage renal disease on developed countries. The CKD diagnosis and its progression require re-evaluation of hypoglycemic therapy and constant dosing adjustments, in order to optimize glycemic control and minimize its side effects. Long acting insulin analogs and its pharmacokinetics have not been studied through different stages of kidney disease and there is no consensus defining the appropriate dosing adjustment based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This research project will compare the glycemic response to intensive insulin treatment with NPH insulin and basal insulin analog (insulin glargine) in type 2 diabetes (DM 2) patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. Patients and methods - Inclusion Criteria: DM 2 patients with CKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy and GFR of 15-59 ml/min/1.73m². Exclusion Criteria: Patients with systemic neoplasia, HIV, CKD or nephropathy from other etiologies, severe psychiatric disorders and pregnant women. Study design: This study consists of a randomized, cross-over, open-label controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups: GROUP 1 - insulin analog glargine once a day and GROUP 2 - NPH human insulin, three applications per day, both group will be treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The laboratory tests will be performed at baseline and 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks after the study start. During routine medical appointments will be analyzed self- monitoring of capillary blood glucose (SMBG) and the hypoglycemia score. After 24 weeks the basal insulin will be changed, i.e. patients using NPH insulin will receive insulin glargine and patients on insulin glargine will be changed to NPH insulin. A CGMS will be carried out at 24 and 48 weeks. Methodology: The metabolic profile will be evaluated throughout SMBG; biochemical, hormonal and hematological measurements; hypoglycemia score and CGMS. Statistical analysis will be performed using comparative descriptive analyzes, such as chi-square distribution, t-test and non-parametric tests. Analyze of data CGMS will include the area under the curve and the related statistic.

The ability of patients to make major adjustments in their lives for dialysis is hampered by depression that affects almost one-quarter of such individuals. There are no studies that have adequately tested whether treatment of depression is effective in dialysis patients and if there is any difference between the response to the two most commonly available forms of treatment, psychotherapy and anti-depressant drug therapy.

To fill this important gap in the investigators knowledge, the investigators propose to undertake (1) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 200 patients to test whether an engagement interview will result in a higher proportion of dialysis patients accepting treatment for depression; and (2) a randomized controlled clinical trial of 120 patients to determine whether there is any difference in the likelihood of improvement of depressive symptoms with psychotherapy or drug therapy among dialysis patients with depression. Patients in these studies will be enrolled from among individuals receiving care in 50 dialysis facilities in three metropolitan areas - Seattle, Dallas, and Albuquerque. The research proposal has been developed with the support of patients, caregivers, and stakeholders to ensure that the findings from the study are relevant to them and can be readily implemented in day-to-day clinical practice. Hence, the engagement interview and psychotherapy will be delivered in a dialysis facility to ease the burden on patients, and the dose of the study drug will be changed in partnership with the study participants. In addition to depressive symptoms, the effect of treatment on other meaningful outcomes such as fatigue and sleep will be determined.

The two forms of treatment for depression being tested in this clinical trial are very different from each other and patients differ with regards to the treatment option preferable and/or available to them. Successful completion of the clinical trial will provide patients, caregivers, and other stakeholders with the information that they would need when faced with a diagnosis of depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This will allow patients to select evidence-based treatments to improve outcomes that are relevant to them.","Depression, End Stage Renal Disease, ","Engagement Interview, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Antidepressant Drug Therapy, ","Number of Participants Who Initiated Depression Treatment, QIDS-C Score, ",chronic kidney disease,"Age, Continuous, Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Sex: Female, Male, Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Ethnicity (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Race (NIH/OMB), Dialysis Vintage, Dialysis Vintage, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Ethnicity (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Race (NIH/OMB)`, `Dialysis Vintage`, `Dialysis Vintage`, "

The specific biochemical pathways that produce these pharmacological effects for MR antagonists, however, are poorly understood. This study investigates the effect of MR antagonism on endothelial function in patients with moderate (stage III) CKD using a randomized, controlled trial. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine if spironolactone improves endothelial function as compared to amiloride in patients with stage III CKD; Aim 2: To determine if oxidative stress is associated with changes in endothelial function by spironolactone compared to amiloride in patients with stage III CKD; and Aim 3: To determine if endothelial dysfunction contributes to albuminuria in patients with stage III CKD.

This illness and treatment significantly impact peoples' health, emotions, work and relationships. To promote person-centred care, healthcare professionals should be asking patients about what matters to them and using this feedback to plan and deliver care. Patient-reported outcome and experience questionnaires (jointly referred to as PROs) allow patients to provide information about their quality of life, symptoms and experiences with care. PROs are increasingly used to help healthcare professionals learn about what is important to patients and the impacts of illness or treatments from patients' point of view. Embedding feedback from patients into routine clinical practice is important in end-stage kidney disease because of the physical and quality of life challenges these patients face when living with kidney failure.

PROs provide vital and often missing information that the healthcare team can use to support patients. However, PROs administered via paper questionnaires have been perceived as cumbersome, difficult to integrate with other health information and do not provide immediate feedback.

In this research, home dialysis patients will have the opportunity to complete electronically administered PROs (ePROs) and healthcare professionals will receive education about how to use PRO information. The goal is to learn how to support healthcare professionals to routinely use this information to inform patient care, and see if this makes a difference in patients' symptoms, person-centred care, quality of life and satisfaction with care.

Learning what matters most to patients is essential for healthcare professionals to provide person-centred care. This research will address the gap in our understanding of how to best use patients' reports in healthcare. Findings of this research may ultimately improve the quality of healthcare for Canadians living with end-stage kidney disease.","Kidney Disease, End-Stage, ","Educational Support, ","Symptoms - Trajectory of Change, Person-centred Care - Trajectory of Change, ",chronic kidney disease,"Age, Continuous, Sex: Female, Male, Race/Ethnicity, Customized, Employment Status, Highlest Level of Education, Type of Dialysis, Diagnoses, ","`Age, Continuous`, `Sex: Female, Male`, `Race/Ethnicity, Customized`, `Employment Status`, `Highlest Level of Education`, `Type of Dialysis`, `Diagnoses`, "

Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare expenditures in adults \>65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment have only short term modest effects.
